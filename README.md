# terratrash-action üóëÔ∏è

This action is a simple wrapper around the [terratrash](https://github.com/GrantBirki/terratrash) Ruby Gem. It is designed to be used in a GitHub Actions workflow to clean up Terraform output text with ease to make it more human readable.

## Usage

```yaml
# you must run the checkout action first
- name: checkout
  uses: actions/checkout@v4

# somewhere in your workflow you might run terraform plan or apply (example here)
# this step shows an example of a terraform plan command where we pipe the output to a file
- name: Terraform plan
  id: plan
  continue-on-error: true
  run: |
    set -o pipefail
    terraform plan -no-color -compact-warnings | tee terraform-output.txt

# now you can use the terratrash-action to clean up the output
- name: terratrash
  uses: GrantBirki/terratrash-action@vX.X.X # replace with the latest version
  with:
    input_file_path: terraform-output.txt
    output_file_path: terraform-output-fmt.txt

# finally you can print the formatted output, save it as an artifact, post it as a PR comment, etc.
- name: Print formatted output
  run: cat terraform-output-fmt.txt
```
